# AsciiDoc Zettlekasten for Desktop

This is a note taking and collecting application for desktop that leverages
AsciiDoc for markup. It leverages [`iced`](https://iced.rs) (an Elm-like library)
to handle the GUI.

The goal is to streamline the learning workflows by providing an easy way to
use a Zettlekasten system and a markup language conducive to book writing.
